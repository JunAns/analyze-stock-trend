# analyze-stock-trend
Creating a Python program to analyze stock trends and predict whether prices will rise or fall tomorrow is an interesting idea, but several important things need to be understood. 
Please note that this stock trend analysis is short-term and medium-term in nature, not long-term, so it is suitable for swing traders and those who are starting out as a reference for testing stock trading in Indonesia (in particular).

Early Warning: 

    Short-term stock price predictions (1 day) are highly uncertain and risky.
    The stock market is influenced by many factors, including: news/media, market sentiment, economic policy, corporate actions, etc.—not just historical data.
    Historical data-based prediction models do not guarantee profits and can lead to losses if relied upon 100%.


However, as a technical exploration or screening tool, we can create a simple prototype.
